# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- This website is created using the different web technologies such as : HTML5, CSS3 and JS ESE6.
- The project structure have the following folders and files :

### css
    - styles.css	
### index.html
### js
    - app.js
### images
    - mixfruit.png
### README.md

### The required changes that I did are based on the project requirements from Udacity and the rest are extra changes from my own design :

- I changed the whole website content and theme to green to match the idea of the website title.
- I updated the navbar style and title to be responsive in the small screens.
- I added new styles in css file using different dimensions to make sure everything is responsive.
- I used what I've learnt in JS in this course including : querySelector(), innerHtml(), createElement() and appendChild().
- I updated the navbar background and hover color.
- I updated the footer using js and css.
- I added a forth section so there are 4 sections.
- I added a button and an image to enhance the content. 
- I set CSS class to active state when the element is in the viewport.
- I used a new function in JS called .getBoundingClientRect() to detect the element location relative to the viewport.
- I used the addEventListener('click',....) function to listen to the click event.
- I used preventDefault() as if there is a default event occurring we need to stop that.
- I used ScrollTo() function and set it to smooth scrolling.
